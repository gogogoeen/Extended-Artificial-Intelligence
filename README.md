# Extended-Artificial-Intelligence
Assignment for extended artificial intelligence

Given a data ‘adult.data’, with 14 features (e.g. “age”, “workclass”, …) and one output result “salary” (two variable >50K and <=50K), use this data and build a machine-learning model in Python with the help of sklearn. Use the trained model and predict the output of ‘adult.test’ and compare with the actual result in the testing data.
